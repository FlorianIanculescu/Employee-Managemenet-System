# Employee-Managemenet-System

## Introduction
This project is a comprehensive example of building a RESTful API using Spring Boot, incorporating various essential components to create a robust and secure application. With full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) support, JPA/Hibernate for database operations, Spring Security for authentication and authorization, and advanced exception handling, this project serves as an excellent starting point for building RESTful services with Spring.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot: The project is built using the Spring Boot framework, which simplifies the development of production-ready applications.

- JPA (Java Persistence API) and Hibernate: Database persistence is managed using JPA with Hibernate as the underlying implementation. This ensures efficient and object-relational mapping.

- Spring Security: The application includes Spring Security for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to the REST endpoints.

- Exception Handling: Comprehensive exception handling is implemented to provide meaningful error messages and handle various types of exceptions gracefully.

- MySQL Database: The project is connected to a MySQL database, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Project Structure
The project follows a standard Spring project structure with packages organized based on functionality:

- **'com.employeemanagement' :** Root package for the project.

- **'controller' :** Houses REST controllers responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and managing CRUD operations while coordinating business logic execution.
  
- **'entity' :** Defines entity classes for database mapping in Spring Boot.

- **'exception' :** Includes custom exception classes and implements exception handling mechanisms to ensure graceful error handling.

- **'repository' :** Provides JPA repositories for interacting with the underlying database, offering convenient methods for data access.

- **'security' :** Contains configuration classes related to Spring Security, including authentication and authorization configurations.

- **'service' :** Implements business logic and orchestrates interactions between controllers and repositories.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-rest-project.git

cd spring-rest-project
```

2. **Configure Database:**

  - Update the application.properties file with your MySQL database configuration.

3. **Build and Run:**
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
  The application will start on 'http://localhost:8080'.

## API Endpoints
The API exposes the following endpoints for performing CRUD operations:

- **Create a new employee:**
  <pre>
  <b>POST</b> : '/api/employees'
  </pre>
  
- **Retrieve all employees:**
  <pre>
  <b>GET</b> : '/api/employees'
  </pre>
  
- **Retrieve a specific employee by ID:**
  <pre>
  <b>GET</b> : '/api/employees/employees{id}'
  </pre>
  
- **Update an existing employee:**
  <pre>
  <b>PUT</b> : '/api/employees'
  </pre>
  
- **Delete an employee by ID:**
  <pre>
  <b>DELETE</b> : '/api/employees/employees{id}'
  </pre>
  
## Authentication and Authorization
Ensuring the security of the API is very important, and this project uses Spring Security to achieve just that. Spring Security offers a robust framework for authentication and authorization, allowing to safeguard the endpoints against unauthorized access effectively. With Spring Security, we have the flexibility to customize authentication mechanisms, such as username-password authentication to suit ourapplication's specific needs. Additionally, we can define access control policies, such as role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict or grant access to different parts of our API based on user roles or specific attributes. Whether we're securing sensitive data or protecting critical operations, Spring Security provides the tools we need to enforce security policies rigorously, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can interact with the API securely.

## Exception Handling
Exception handling is a crucial aspect of any robust application, and this project employs advanced mechanisms to handle exceptions gracefully, thereby enhancing the overall user experience. With comprehensive exception handling, the API can detect and respond to various exceptional scenarios effectively. By providing detailed error messages, the API assists developers and end-users alike in understanding the nature of encountered issues, facilitating troubleshooting and resolution.
