# Employee-Managemenet-System

## Project Overview
This Spring REST project is designed to provide a robust and secure API with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project leverages the following technologies and features:

- Spring Boot: The project is built using the Spring Boot framework, which simplifies the development of production-ready applications.

- JPA (Java Persistence API) and Hibernate: Database persistence is managed using JPA with Hibernate as the underlying implementation. This ensures efficient and object-relational mapping.

- Spring Security: The application includes Spring Security for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to the REST endpoints.

- Exception Handling: Comprehensive exception handling is implemented to provide meaningful error messages and handle various types of exceptions gracefully.

- MySQL Database: The project is connected to a MySQL database, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval.
